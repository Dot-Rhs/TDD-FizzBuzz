# Test Driven Development Example - FizzBuzz
---

To run this test example, clone the repo down. Install Jest if you haven't already using *npm install --save-dev jest*.
You can they type *npm test* which will launch the Jest test suite on my FizzBuzz code.

There is also a commented out function that count's to 100 using FizzBuzz.
